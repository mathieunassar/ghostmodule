 *	Commands can then be invoked by either one of the following ways:
 *	- providing a ghost::CommandLine object that will contain the necessary parameters for this command;
 *	- providing a string containing the shortcut of the command, followed by the parameters, separated
 *		by spaces.
 *	If a string is provided to the interpreter, its parameter list will be parsed as follows:
 *	- parameters are separated by a space;
 *	- parameter names begin with a dash ('-') or a double dash ('--');
 *	- a value corresponding to a parameter must immediatly follow the parameter name (separated by a space);
 *	- if no parameter name precedes a value (without dash), then the value belongs to a parameter with no name;
 *	- it is possible to provide a parameter without a value; its presence can still be checked in the
 *		ghost::CommandLine class.
