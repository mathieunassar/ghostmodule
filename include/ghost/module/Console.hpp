/**
 *	Makes abstraction of the program console and allows user i/o with ease.
 *	Provides methods to write on the console and to read lines from it.
 *	Per default, the console starts in output mode. In this mode, every call to
 *	std::cout or to the method "write" of this class will be output on the console
 *	window.
 *	The mode switches to the input mode if the user presses on "enter". This mode lets
 *	the user enter command, which then can be retrieved by setting a callback with the
 *	method "setCommandCallback".
 *	Depending on the input mode which can be set by "setInputMode", the mode will be switched
 *	back to output every time the user enters a command (in case of a "DISCRETE" input mode),
 *	or solely when the user enters an empty line.
 *	It is also possible for the program to request a line from the user, with the method
 *	"getLine". The method will flush the output (write everything on the buffer) and query
 *	the user.
