	 * @brief Factory that creates Connection objects based on a connection configuration.
	 * 
	 * The factory contains connection types mapped to minimal connection configurations.
	 * When creating connections based on a connection configuration, the factory searches
	 * for the first entry in the map, for which the given configuration matches the minimal
	 * required configuration.
	 * 
	 * For example, the default implementation of the connection manager adds factory rules
	 * for network based connections. The minimum configuration for such connections contain
	 * a server IP address and a remote port number (note that this minimal configuration can
	 * be created by the default constructor of NetworkConnectionConfiguration). Hence,
	 * attempting to create a connection with a NetworkConnectionConfiguration will match
	 * these factory rules.
	 * 
	 * The public interface of the connection factory only allows the user to add more rules.
	 * Creating connections using the factory can only be done through the ConnectionManager.
