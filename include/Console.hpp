	/**
	 *	Makes abstraction of the program console and allows user i/o with ease.
	 *	Provides methods to write on the console and to read lines from it.
	 *	Per default, the console starts in output mode. In this mode, every call to
	 *	std::cout or to the method "write" of this class will be output on the console
	 *	window.
	 *	The mode switches to the input mode if the user presses on "enter". This mode lets
	 *	the user enter command, which then can be retrieved by setting a callback with the
	 *	method "setCommandCallback".
	 *	Depending on the input mode which can be set by "setInputMode", the mode will be switched
	 *	back to output every time the user enters a command (in case of a "DISCRETE" input mode),
	 *	or solely when the user enters an empty line.
	 *	It is also possible for the program to request a line from the user, with the method
	 *	"getLine". The method will flush the output (write everything on the buffer) and query
	 *	the user.
