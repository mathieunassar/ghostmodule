/**
 *	Base class for operations on a gRPC async connection (represented by ghost::internal::RPC).
 *	This class provides a base implementation to handle a completed completion queue tag, and
 *	manages the lifetime of the operation.
 *	The class ensures that the operation is not executed twice simultaneously.
 *
 *	Operations can be configured to be blocking and/or automatically restarted.
 *	- If an operation is non-blocking and autorestarted, then it will be restarted from the
 *	completion queue thread (calling start will not block).
 *	- If an operation is blocking and autorestarted, then calling start is blocking until the RPC
 *	is finsihed.
